# Dicee-iOS13.5 

## Objective

Auto Layout is used for better user interface. Because mobile screens have different resolutions and sizes, we need these rules to tell the iPhone/iPad how it should layout all the elements in the storyboard onto the display. 

## What you will create

Although Dicee is already pretty dicey, we get into problems when we try to rotate the screen to landscape or if we have a screen size that is not the same as the canvas. In this module, weâ€™ll learn how to fix this and make our apps look exactly the way we want.

## What you will learn

* How to add constraints and understanding how Auto Layout works.
* How to Pin and Align elements.
* How to create containers to configure advanced layouts.
* How to debug auto layout errors.
* Understanding what Xcode needs in order to correctly layout a design.
* How to use Stack Views to create complex interfaces.
